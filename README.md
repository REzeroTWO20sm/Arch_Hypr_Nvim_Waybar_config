# Welcome!

This is my personal configuration for my Arch Linux system, featuring:

- Hyprland Environment
- Neovim IDE
- Kitty Terminal with Fish Shell
- Custom Waybar with Personal/GPT Scripts
- All Necessary Packages

I created this repository for myself and anyone else who might have questions. Feel free to reach out to me on Telegram: [@RE_zeroTWO20sm](https://t.me/RE_zeroTWO20sm).

I'm a novice in this area, but I'm happy to provide assistance where I can.

## Special Thanks

2. [@ChatGPT_General_Bot on Telegram](https://t.me/ChatGPT_General_Bot): As a Russian speaker, this bot was invaluable for understanding English.
